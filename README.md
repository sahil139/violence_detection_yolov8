# violence_detection_yolov8

Object Detection System created using YOLOv8 for real-time video processing.

Dataset Used: Custom video dataset with labeled objects.

Developed and trained a custom YOLOv8 model:

Integrated the model with OpenCV for processing video frames.
Implemented real-time object detection with bounding boxes and labels.
Optimized detection thresholds for precision and accuracy.
Achieved reliable performance in detecting and labeling objects in video streams, with outputs saved to video files.

üìù Currently working on enhancing the model's accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring different YOLOv8 variants.
